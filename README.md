## Project Description
This project will be carried out using the Python programming language. Our main objectives are:

• Gain a general overview of the e-commerce dataset and its contents.

• Apply data cleaning and preprocessing steps, handle missing data, and address data inconsistencies.

• Visualize the data to identify interesting patterns, trends, and outliers.

• Perform basic statistical analyses to answer relevant questions.

• Understand customer profiles through segmentation and grouping analyses.



## Technologies Used
• **Python**: The core programming language for data analysis, manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

• **Pandas**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.

• **NumPy**: A fundamental package for numerical computations in Python.

• **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.

• **PyCharm**: An integrated development environment for Python.

• **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for interactive coding and documenting analysis results.


## Analysis Steps
**1- Data Loading and Overview**:

• Load the e-commerce dataset using Pandas.

• Display basic information about the dataset like column names, data types, and first few rows.

**2- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:

• Handle missing data by imputation or removal.

• Address data inconsistencies and anomalies.

• Convert data types if needed.

**3- Data Visualization**:

• Create histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize distributions and relationships.

• Use bar plots and pie charts to show categorical data proportions.

• Identify outliers and potential anomalies through visual exploration.
